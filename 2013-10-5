Reflection 5

This week we finally started to program. This is both exciting and stressful. As the administrator of my vertical
group I received quite a bit of pressure from the other group members to get the data parsed early so we have time 
left for analysis. 

I have never programed in python before so it has been rather difficult. So far, I had the most difficulty getting started. 
I wasn't sure what I was doing as I was unfamiliar with the python syntax. It took me a long
time to figure out how to start gspread and then how to parse out the columns that I wanted. Now I need to work on 
brushing up my regular expressions and figuring out how to clean and organize the data. 

One thing I realized through this process was that the administator seems to have a disproportionate role as compared to 
the other members. This is especially true for individuals like me, who have never programed in python before. The task of 
data curation is time consuming as curators have to deal with the nitty gritty of the data. Other members get the fruits 
of our labor and gets to work with the clean, organized data that we come up with. 

I also found on github that visualizers can use R to play with the data. To me this is an unfair advantage as most of the
visualization can be easily done on R as most of us have a strong background in R. Perhaps these complaints are an indicator
of need to switch to a different role for the next project. I do enjoy learning python, that is afterall, one of the things
that drew me to this course, but it can get frustrating when you have a deadline to meet. 

Aside from these factors, doing this project has reminded me the importance of documentation. Coding in a new language 
made me realize that documentation can save a lot of time for myself as well as other people. This is something that I 
will definitely incorporate into my future projects and my lifestyle in general.

Lastly, I'm extremely appreciative of the fact that the instructors are actualizing the feedback the students gave in the
past few classes. I really feel like we are doing something in this class, and I'm excited.
