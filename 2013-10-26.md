Reflection 8

I'm excited that we will finally start working on the earthquake data. I finally understand why we went through the previous
two projects before we dive into this stage. I can see how the skills that we learned from the previous two projects are
useful in this setting. Dividing everyone into the four roles is especially useful as this breaks down the project into 
more managable bits and streamlines the work process in a way that makes it easier to complete. I also appreciate 
exercise of putting questions on the issue tracker. I find that this is a good way to get questions resolved and allow
people to contribute to one another's learning. 
I am however a bit worried about working as a data curator at this stage of the project. Interestingly, I noticed that many
people in my horizontal group do not have much programing experience. This might be a roadblack as the data curation role
requires quite a bit of computational experience. I for one, lack this and hope that I can still contribute my part for
the data curation group. 
I am also a bit worried about the grading scheme. Often times I want to help others with their learning, but due to my lack
of expertise in ipython notebook and github I have a hard time answering people's questions on the issue tracker. Of course
I help whenver I can, but I worry that this might impact my overall grade at the end.
My personal goal for taking this class is to learn how to program in python. I also hope to get a better sense of how to
work with other people and manage the process in a way that is organized and cohesive. I feel that this class does a great
job splitting the project into manageable parts and I want to learn this process so that I can apply it in other settings
outside of class. In terms of learning python, I would like to dedicate more of my spare time to doing the python tutorials
online. I also hope to to learn on my own by working on the projects.
