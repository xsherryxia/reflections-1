Reflection 6

This week I found the in class presentations to be very interesting. All teams approached the projects differently and
encountered different roadblocks along the way. I feel that by sharing the process of how each team developed their 
project really helped me get a better idea of the concept of reproducibility, and get a better sense of what I 
can do better next time. One thing that I learned that I want to incorporate into my group's next project is to make
use of github to better document our code instead of just leaving comments within the code to let users know what we did.
Particularly, I would like to include a textbox for code that we run in the github document page.I think this will be 
more clear and visually appealing.

I also found the retrospective we did on Thursday to be very helpful. Diving into another group's code clearly 
demonstrates what reproducible means. I feel that now I have a better grasp of what the instructor expects in the 
projects,and I think my group can better meet that expectation for the next project.

The pluses and deltas exercise within our group also helped. For our next project we will work on going to office hours
and better communication. 

Below are some notes I took on the presentations. I think the notes will help my group improve our project for the next
assignment. 

Notes on Stat157 Presentations
10/8/2013

Group 1- Presentation
How did everyone get to learn the subject?

Group 2: Presentation
How people learn and what kind of roles people took on in groups?
Tried to enforce reproducibility.
Averages of role and learning styles.
Addressed anomalies in the data.

Group 3. Presentation
Used R. 
Compared learning styles to number of leaders in each topic.
Could not reproduce so used R. 
Paying cost upfront. Talk to professor earlier. Reproducibility is the key.
How reproducible is it and how do you know?
Included version number and the system that we ran it on….
Instructions should be clear.
Distinction between code you should run verbatim and text that tells you interesting information.
Github flavored markdown.
…sh
Text
…sh
Logtech, sh.
Try to do most things in the virtual machine.
Back up your computer.

Group 4. Presentation
Talked about roadblocks. Couldn’t run virtual machine. Had to meet in OH. It was their administrator. 
Personal experience beforehand and learning styles.
Data wasn’t complete.
Analyzed the columns separately.
How do I know what data has been removed. 
What do we do about empty slots? How did you take care of it?

Group 5. Presentation
Traits of technical leads.
Used html to code.
Used R. 
# of programs that you are comfortable being a technical lead.
Why we care? Qualities of technical lead.
What is positive correlation?

Group 6. Presentation
Learning style and roles. Focused on one role. 
How likely a person is an administrator, but looking at their learning style?
Many empty cells. 
Wise strategy to focus on one thing at a time. Focus on one and make it reproducible.

Group 7. Presentation
Learning style and classes that people have taken.
Used R.
Used pair t tests. 
Quantified in a statistical way.
There was no significant relationship.
Scatterplot matrix, and heatmap.
All through online communication.
A lot of Unicode characters. Removed the Unicode characters one by one.
Isolated stats and cs classes.
Unicode very difficult to deal with.
Explored lots of graphing styles.
What are we to take away from the plot if we don’t know what it means?

Group 8
Learning preferences (4 categories to learn the best in) and known computer science languages.
Outlined everything in steps. 
Talked about installing R to run the code. Part of reproducibility.
Did an ANOVA analysis. Also gives examples of how/ what the ANOVA analysis means.
No significant patterns.
Use visualization to make sure that results from the test was true.
Most learners where kinesthetic.
Major roadblocks: timeline issue, skill set pairing issues, github and ipython problems. 
Strategies to collaborate with groups and overcoming roadblocks.

Group 9
Programing proficiencies and learning preferences.
Talked about their process.
Missing a curator. 
What resources help you the most? 
Utilizing CS majors or utilizing the skills that you have.

See in reflections what were the skills that you leaned on people for and things you picked up yourself. Key strokes, etc. 

Group 10
Resorted to R as the analyst tool
Got data as a csv file.
Type of programming languages and learning style.
Made a word cloud.
No patterns. 
Explained how he made the graphs. 
Look for correlation between number of languages and type of learning style you are categorized in.
Had a slide on what trends he found. 
Not able to meet up personally.
Word cloud was exceptional. Really good use of graphics.
Turn data into visualization into insight. 

Group 11
Career goals and leanrning styles.
Doing the work together not necessarily just their roles.
Spent a long time to get SSH set up.
Reproducibility not perfection.
Best way to do this, work together…
Visualization has the highest mean.
Top 8 career goals in stat 157. Actuary being the highest.
What is collaboration? Reproducibility is not just being able to reproduce but also to 
Document the process. 

Presentations that you will be giving are every other week. You will have two week iteration. Two Tuesdays from now 
you will be presenting again. 

Thursday: Doing a retrospective. Diving into someone else’s code. Just how reproducible your code is? 
Reproduce what another group does?
