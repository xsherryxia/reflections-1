#Reflection 13

This week Fernando Perez came to speak during lecture about his motivation for creating iPython and how iPython can be used
for science. I was surprised that iPython was created out of a need for a better tools for science. The ability for iPython
to be a useful scientific tool was not something that was clear to me prior to Fernando's talk. The projects that I have
worked on in stat157 did not convince me that there were particular advantages that iPython offered as a program.
Fernando's talk howevever clarified this for me. He showed how reproducibility is integrated into iPython and its open 
access allows scientists to address problems in their research early on. I was also impressed by iPython's ability to 
produce complicated graphs on the same platfrom and how the notebook itself can be used for presentations. All in all,
I found the lecture by Fernando to be extremely interesting.
One thing I would like to point out however is that this lecture would be more useful if it had been made at the beginning
of the course, when we were just being introduced to iPython. It would have served as a great introduction to learning how
to program in iPython and why we have chosen to use this program for this course.

I also really appreicated the fact that professor Stark was also able to attend the lecture on Tuesday. He was particularly 
helpful to my group, as we were able to ask him essential questions concerning the code after class. This helped us check 
our work and better understand how we can improve here on.
