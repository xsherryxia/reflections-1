Reflection 14
===============

This week we went over what we needed to do for the rest of the semester. With the data science fair fast approaching
the class as a whole has been scrambling to get the presentations ready for the final presentation at the data science fair.
As a whole I really appreicated Carl and Sam taking the lead to organize a cohesive way through which the groups can
piece together what they have done so far so that the presenters can have a narrative with which to present. In particular,
I really support the use of the google docs during class time to fill out the main repositories and what not each group
has, so that the presenters can use this information in creating the presentation for the class. 

One thing that I think the
class needs to focus more on, which might have been lost half way through the class, is how reproducibility played into our
project. For my group, the Quakers, we used a lot of code through R and other programs to visualize the earthquake data. This
information is hard to reproduce without an adequate understanding of the ETAS and MDA model. Even though our repositories
are clearly labled, I can understand how other groups may have difficulty understand our code and rationale for doing various
things in our project. One thing I think helped was the in class presentations from individual groups. While writting can 
aid a person's ability to replicate a project, I think communication can better give the audience and undestanding of what
we did. In particular, my group was very keen on presenting our progress so that other groups can know what we have done, and 
be able to build upon what we did or ask questions and offer advice on what we have done so we can progress. This is why 
we have also included our in class presentation power point links on github.

One thing I'm confused about as of now is who is working on the suggestions made by professor Stark on Tuesday as other models
which we can explore to beat ETAS. I was a bit frustrated by the fact that this lecture was given so late during the semester.
Had we had this insight prior to Tuesday, we may have been able to focus more time and energy into this idea. This is another
reason for why I want to emphasis again the importance of having statistics graduate students or professor working along side 
the class as part of any project that requires statistical analysis. I believe that had we had this support, we would have been
able to make more progress on the project then we did. 

Overall, I would like thank the class administrators for a fun and interesting class. I am happy to have worked on this project
and be exposed to the importance of open data, and reproducibility in science. Thanks so much!
