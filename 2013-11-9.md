Reflection 10

This week we saw a lot of changes in the way we run things in class. Instead of the administrators taking charge, individual
students took upon themselves the responsibility of running our class during lectures. Agenda is organized and neatly
broken down to specific tasks that each individual should attend to. This way, I felt that the class as a whole was able
to use class time more effectively and everyone seem to have a clear idea of how they can contribute to achieve our overall
goal.

We found out this week that the curators finished their task of data curation. This meant that data curators had to find a 
new way to contribute to the class. We decided to split the curator into two groups. One group would focus on helping 
the visualizer and analyzer groups while the other group would start doing research on how to write the final paper publication
for the class. As I have experience writing papers, I felt that I can best serve the purpose of this project my helping the
paper publication team. So far we have identified the roadblocks to be what type of paper we want to write which depends on
what type of journal we want to publish. We have attempted to address this roadblock by reaching out to Aaron who has reached
out to Professor Stark regarding this matter. 

As to achieving my personal goals of learning ipython, I will try to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the data lab
and go there to take lessons in ipython.
