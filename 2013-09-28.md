Statistics 157

Reflection 4

Concerning This Week In General:
This week I was able to successfuly install linux, vagrant, and ipython notebook to my system. This is a great feat 
because for the first time in three weeks I could actually access ipython notebook. 

This week I really enjoyed the talk we had on reproducibility and why it is part of the stat 157 curriculum. During our
class disuccsion about reproduciblity and why it's important, I found it interesting that many students seem to indicate 
a lack on interest the concept. I agree with some of the classmates who spoke up that reproducibility wasn't 
exactly what we expected to learn from this course. I understand that the class is titled "Reproducible and Collaborative 
Data Science" but I didn't know what those terms meant and I'm sure many other classmates didn't understand either.
I believe that many of us were misled by the course description. I, for one, was under the impression that the course
would expose me to lots of programming tools, and that to me was essentially the main purpose of the class. 
I wanted to learn how to use those tools so I can have an edge in the job market. That was why I wanted to take the class.
So in this respect, I understand why many students are frustrated by the fact that we still haven't been 
able to "get our hands dirty" with programming.

This week, I also appreciated the facilitators' explaination of what we had been doing these last few weeks and 
why we had to do those things. That really helped put things in perspective for me. I also appreciated the real 
life examples Kristina shared about the issue of reproducibility in relation to her own research. It really helped 
to put the importance of reproducibility in a concrete context.

Concerning Reproducibility:
Since a big part of statistics deals with experiments, I believe that being able to reproduce data under similar conditions 
is extremely important to bolstering the validity of one's experimental results. So to me being able to create an 
experiment that is reproducible would definitely help in the scientific search for the truth. Also, I'm currently writing
a paper on the use of statistical evidence in court, and one aspect I'm particularly interested in is how courts decide 
what statistical evidence is valid. I think reproducibility plays a big role in this context because all else equal, 
evidence generated from an experiment that is reproducible is more reliable than evidence generated from an experiment 
that is not as reproducible. So in this respect, I understand why the facilitators feel that reproducibility is 
an important concept. I can't really think of a justification against reproducibility. Perhaps reproducbility would 
not be useful if researchers wanted to hide the experiment methods they used because they conducted a bad experimental 
design or didn't want to share how they genearted the results they did.
