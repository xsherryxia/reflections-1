Reflection 3

This week was interesting because we had two guest speakers come speak to our class. Both speakers were extremely interesting 
and their topics shed light on the process of conducting an experiment. I especially enjoyed Eric Berlow's talk. 
I found the presentation he gave on impacts of various factors on a frog population in Yosemite to be a great 
overview of what conducting an experiment involves. Each step was presented in detail, and the
real life problems Eric faced in data collection and analysis really piqued my interest. These problems showed me that 
real life experiments can never be perfect, that there will always be problems which we must account for.

On another note, I attended the office hours held at Cory this Friday. I really appreciated the GSIs' help, but unfortunatey,
I had some trouble installing the linux system on my windows 8 pc. I noticed during office hours that many classmates encountered
different problems even though we were all trying to install linux to our systems. Some computers were faster at installing
linux, and others, like mine, ran into various roadblocks in the installation process. This was rather troublesome
for our GSI, since he had to deal with each person's particular problem individually. It was extremely difficult to
streamline the process so that people can get on the same page fast. I also learned during office hours that
documentation is important. When we had to re-install ipython notebook on our computers, many people did not 
remember the commands that Aaron had told us in class. Luckily, I was able to locate this information from our 
class IRC conversation log. This was able to help several students set up shop when the GSI was occupied. 
I have included notes that I took on installing the ipython notebook below to document this process. 

sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook
mkdir notebooks
git init
sudo apt-get install git
cd notebooks
ipython notebooks --ip=0.0.0.0 
q
y
ifconfig
inet addr:10.0.2.15 <this should be your IP address>
ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser

This is the class conversation we had about installing ipython notebook. It's basically the same as what I put above.
(10:09:34 AM) aculich: use this command: sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook
(10:19:57 AM) aculich: mkdir notebooks
(10:20:15 AM) aculich: git init
(10:21:12 AM) arifyali: sudo apt-get install git
(10:23:09 AM) ashleysia: after that, I type in mkdir notebooks and it says "mkdir: cannot create directory 'notebooks': File exists
(10:24:08 AM) aculich: next enter the directory with: cd notebooks
(10:24:31 AM) aculich: ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0

I believe that when installing ipython notebook on linux you have to do the following. These are just some additional
steps to the ones I listed above.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git ipython vagrant ipython-notebook
ipython notebook
