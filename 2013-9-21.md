Reflection 3

This week was interesting because we had two guest speakers come to our class. Both speakers were extremely interesting 
and their topics shed light on what we plan on doing in this class. I especially enjoyed Eric Berlow's talk. I found the
presentation he gave on the research he did exploring the impacts of various factors on a frog population in 
Yosemite to really shed light on what conducting experiments involve. Each step was presented in detail, and the
real life problems Eric faced in data collection and analysis really piqued my interest. These problems showed me that 
real life experiments can never be perfect, that there will always be problems which we must account for.

On another note, I attended the office hours held at Cory this Friday. I really appreciated the GSI's help, but unfortunatey,
I had some trouble installing the linux system on my windows 8 pc. I noticed during office hours that many classmates encountered
different problems even though we were all trying to install linux to our systems. Some computers were faster at installing
linux, and others, like mine, had trouble with the installation. This was rather troublesome for our instructor, since having
different problems meant that he had to deal with each person's problem individually. There was no way to streamline the 
process so that people can get on the same page fast. I also learned during office hours that documentation is important. 
When we had to re-install ipython notebook on our computers, many people did not remember the commands that Aaron had 
told us in class. Luckily, I was able to locate this information from our class RLC conversation log. This was able to
help several students set up shop when the GSI was occupied. I have included notes that I took on installing the ipython
notebook below to document this process. 

sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook
mkdir notebooks
git init
sudo apt-get install git
cd notebooks
ipython notebooks --ip=0.0.0.0 
q
y
ifconfig
inet addr:10.0.2.15 <this should be your IP address>
ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser

This is the class conversation we had about installing ipython notebook. It's basically the same as what I put above.
(10:09:34 AM) aculich: use this command: sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook
(10:19:57 AM) aculich: mkdir notebooks
(10:20:15 AM) aculich: git init
(10:21:12 AM) arifyali: sudo apt-get install git
(10:23:09 AM) ashleysia: after that, I type in mkdir notebooks and it says "mkdir: cannot create directory 'notebooks': File exists
(10:24:08 AM) aculich: next enter the directory with: cd notebooks
(10:24:31 AM) aculich: ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0

I believe that when installing ipython notebook on linux however you can do the following.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git ipython vagrant ipython-notebook
ipython notebook
