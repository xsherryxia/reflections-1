Reflection 1

I encountered problems following instructions on downloading the virtual machine. I tried googling instructions on installing the virtual machine and rereading the directions given for downloading the Virtual Machine. Rereading the directions helped because I was able to find a line in the instruction that specifically addressed my question. I thought about posting my question on Pidgin, but I didn’t because nobody else had at that point. 

Group time during the second day of class also really helped because I realized that there were other group members who encountered similar problems as I did. Having group time also helped me better understand how to use github. I also tried to help someone who didn’t attend the first day of class to install her Pidgin account. However she was using a Mac while I used a PC. We quickly realized that there were major differences in terms of how to set up an account in both of these platforms. 

I found staying after class to be the most helpful way to get my questions answered, especially when my problem was unique from that of other classmates. I hope that in the future we will get a scheduled office hour time.
