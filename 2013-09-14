Statistics 157

Reflection 2

I feel that there is a real need to create a forum outside of class through which students can ask questions. Something 
like Piazza might be good for this purpose because it organizes questions that are submitted in a systematic manner
and makes it extremely easy for students who have similar quesitons to peruse. I think this tool might serve a better 
purpose than the stat157 chat room because the questions we ask there aren't very well organized and students must 
navigage through the whole conversation to find the information that they need. This of course can be an extremely time
consuming process. 

Overall, this week has been good. I really enjoyed the pluses and deltas activity we did in class. This activity provided a 
forum through which students can address questions that they encountered thus far. I think it was also a good check-in for
the temperature of the class.

This week I particularly enjoyed interacting with my group members. We are all extremely open to helping one another out. 
I think this is one of the best parts about Stat157. It is extremely impressive that we can create such a cooperative 
and supportive enviornment for learning. This is something that I think many classes lack here at Berkeley. Often times
competition keeps students from being copperative and this in turn hinders everyone's learning as a whole.

I hope that in the following weeks we can spend more time actually coding and working on projects. It seems that we have
a lot to get through in this class, and while I really enjoy learning about the prolbems that we can face in the real world,
I hope to get my feet wet working on the projects soon. 

I look forward to the speakers next week! :)
