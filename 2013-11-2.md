Reflection 9

I felt that the presentation Chris gave on the heart of the question we are after for the earthquake project was very 
helpful. Even though I will not directly work on figuring out how to analyze the earthquake data to test the ETAS model,
Chris's explanation help shed some light as to my role as a data curator. Specifically, one of the road blocks in my horizontal
group dealt whether we have to extract earthquake data from just Southern California or the entire world. I realized
from Chris' presentation today that there is not an incentive to tackle the second problem, that is, to extract earthquake
data on the whole world. This is becuase for the purpose of this project we simply need a training set with which to test 
our model. How much data we need will depend on what the analyzers need to test our model. This does not require us to 
gather data on the whole world. In fact, data on California earthquakes might be enough.

The roadblocks in my horizontal group is now figuring out how to transport the data we got from the SCEC to github. The
problem is that while we were able to extract the file as a csv from the SCEC webiste we found that the file was too big
to be able to upload on github. In order to overcome this problem we plan on transfering the data from a csv file to
a google doc which people can access through gspread. This will be one of the problems my vertical group will tackle. 
Another problem my vertical group will tackle is figuring out how much data we need to extract as data curators for the 
purpose of this project. I think this part of the project will involve communicating with professor Stark on what might
be statistically sufficient to support his ETAS model.
