Reflection 7

This week Professor Stark came to give a presentation of a more detailed summary of what we plan to do in this class. 
This was an extremely important lecture because it laid out the foundation for the project that we will be working on for
the rest of the class. Professor Stark aaddressed the deficiencies of the ETAS model for predicting earthquakes. 
Pointing out that this system is based on faulty assumptions about earthquakes and is extremely complex. He notes that 
he and his colleagues have come up with a simpler and competitive model, namely, the magnitude-dependent automoatic alarms 
system which competitively when tested along side ETAS. Magnitude-dependentautomatic alarms trigger an alarm system that 
indicates the probability and size of future earthquakes after a trigger. Our project this semester will be to improve 
upon this system so that it be just as a good predictor if not a better predictor than the ETAS model. Specifically, 
we want to focus on estimating Tau*mu^Magnitude so as to make ita better predictor than the ETAS model. We will build 
upon other people's code and use the data we gather online to find a better estimate for Tau*mu^Magnitude. 

I am both excited about the project and a little scared about its implications. I still haven't quite gotten used to using
ipython notebook and I fear that this will be the biggest roadblock that I will encounter. I can try to overcome this 
roadblock by spending more time on watching ipython tutorials and such.
