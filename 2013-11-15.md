Reflection 11

This week in class I really enjoyed listening to the presentations by the presenter group on earthquake. I found the presentation
to be extremely useful. Part of reason for this is that I was able to gain a better understanding of what earthquakes are
like. This was something that had been previously overlooked. I felt that going over how earthquakes were formed and the potential
impacts it can have shed more light upon potential methods that we can explore to model the earthquakes.I also appreicate 
the explanation that Chris gave on the ETAS model. It helped clarify what we have to accomplish for the rest of our project.

In terms of issues and roadbloacks, I found the survey to be a bit confusing. In particular, I was confused about what group
I am in. Part of the reason for this is that upon finishing the curation part of the project, the curator group decided to 
split the group in two. One group was suppose to be assigned to smaller groups to aid their efforts in their parts of the project,
while the other group was suppose to work on writing the paper. However we did not update this change to everyone in class,
so these groups were not incorporated into the possible groups that we can choose from in the drop down menu on the survey.
I clarified this situation in my survey, but many other members in my group took a different approach. Some people indicated
that they were part of the original groups that was established, and others went according to the grou passignments made by
Laura on github. However, I believe, Laura was not informed about the establishment of a paper writing group and therefore
did not indicate this on the project agenda. As a result, I felt that there was definitely some confusion in the curator group
concerning what they belonged to. 

I would like to suggest that future assignments should be notified to students at least in the class before the 
assignment is due so as to give students more time to prepare and allocate time for such assignemtns. I think we would all 
appreciate a notification in class on the survey assigned this Wednesday which a large part of our grade depended on. 
I think this would also give people more time to think about what they can write and address in class any potential 
issues that may come up. Personally, I felt the deadline to be rather rushed and I found it surprising that it was do 
in the next class. Otherwise, I felt the survey to be helpful as it would give the administrators a better sense of where
we are as a class.
